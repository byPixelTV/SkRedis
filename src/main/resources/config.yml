# Enable support for RediVelocity
# RediVelocity is a Velocity plugin, that is basically a copy of RedisBungee, but modern and for Velocity
# It is recommended to use RediVelocity instead of RedisBungee, as it is more modern and has more features
# But SkRedis has support for both, so you can use either
# Only enable use-json if you don't want a already formatted message and handle that yourself, I recommend SkJson for JSON in Skript

#the channels from which this server can receive messages
#you can always send messages to all channels!
#you can add as many channels as you wish!

#ideal setup is having one global channel and having one channel that represents server name, so you know who to send messages to
#then a few other utility channels up to your needs
channels:
  - "global"
  - "servername"
  - "Channel3"
